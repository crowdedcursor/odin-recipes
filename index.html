    <h2>Chicken Tikka Masala</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken Tikka Masala is one of the most popular dishes in India and for
      good reason. This flavorful dish made with grilled marinated chicken
      pieces in a delicious spiced curry sauce is by far one of the best ways to
      introduce yourself and friends to Indian cuisine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chicken is first marinated in yogurt and spices then grilled until
      slightly charred. My favorite part is the masala sauce that is is simply
      amazing, a tomato and cream sauce very rich in flavor due to all the
      spices that pairs so well with the grilled chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicken Tikka Masala is best served with basmati rice and Naan for a great
      lunch or dinner experience. Enjoy!
