    <h2>Classic Indian dish is our go-to when we order takeout.</h2>
    <p>
      Tangy and deeply spiced, tikka masala is a tomato and cream sauce that
      traditionally includes garam masala, turmeric, ginger, garlic, and chiles.
      It also features all the delicious flavors from a batch of the same spices
      included in the tikka marinade.

      <li>1 c. whole-milk yogurt</li>
      <li>2 lb. skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil or ghee</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>
        1 to 3 fresh red chiles, seeded and finely chopped, or 1/4 to 1/2 tsp.
        crushed red pepper flakes
      </li>
      <li>2 1/2 c. tomato puree</li>
      <li>1 c. heavy cream</li>
      <li>
        1/2 c. fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped, plus more for serving
      </li>
      <li>Steamed basmati rice and naan, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix garlic, ginger, garam masala, coriander, turmeric,
        cumin, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, and 1/4 teaspoon salt until a paste
        forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, stir yogurt, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and half of spice
        paste until well combined; cover and refrigerate remaining spice paste.
        Place chicken on a cutting board. Using a paring knife, make a few
        shallow cuts in each breast. Add to bowl and turn to coat. Cover and
        refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 6 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and chiles and
        cook, stirring often, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add remaining 1/3
        cup tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened, 2 to 3
        minutes. Add remaining spice paste and cook, stirring constantly, until
        fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomato puree and 1/2 cup water, scraping up any browned bits in
        bottom of pot. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often and reducing
        heat to low if needed to maintain a gentle simmer, until mixture
        thickens, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in cream and gently simmer, stirring
        frequently, until slightly thickened, 10 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, preheat broiler with an oven rack 6" from heat. Line a rimmed
        baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack inside sheet. Transfer
        chicken with marinade to rack and arrange in a single layer. Spoon any
        remaining marinade in bowl over chicken. Broil until chicken is mostly
        cooked and marinade has thickened and is golden in spots (chicken will
        not be fully cooked at this point), 10 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut chicken into bite-size chunks. Add chicken and cilantro to tomato
        mixture. Very gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is
        cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide Butternut Squash Basmati Rice among bowls. Spoon chicken tikki
        masala over. Top with cilantro. Serve with naan alongside.
      </li>
